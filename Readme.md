j2c-locale
=================

This should be considered part of the internal support classes for the emulated `java.util.Locale` and should not be referenced in code.
It contains some utilties that can be used to assist the authoring of annotation processors that generate code or data that is Locale aware,
such as the emulation of `java.text` and others.

TODO Create a list of annotation processors and parent public project.

The preferred way to use the plugin is to checkout the source

```bash
git clone git://github.com/mP1/j2cl-locale.git
